## DataBase
A relational DB like MySQL might be a better approach to solve this  challenge, however, I felt the same could be  achieved using MongoDB with Mongoose ORM, besides, I feel more comfortable working with these technologies.  
(You can see the data saved in mongoDB Atlas and verify that all the requirements were solved)
